# SemEval-2026 Task 4: Narrative Story Similarity  
### Group Project Repository

This repository contains our group’s work for **SemEval-2026 Task 4: Narrative Story Similarity and Narrative Representation Learning**.

The goal of the task is to identify **narratively similar stories** based on three core components:

- **Abstract Theme** – the underlying ideas and motives of the story  
- **Course of Action** – the sequence of key events and turning points  
- **Outcomes** – the final results or consequences of the story  

For more details, see the official task page:
